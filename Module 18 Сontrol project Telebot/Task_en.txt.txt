The task is to create the following Telegram bot.

1. The bot returns the price for a certain amount of currency (euro, dollar or ruble).
2. When writing a bot, you need to use the pytelegrambotapi library.
3. A person should send a message to the bot in the form of: <name of the currency the price of which he wants to find out> <name of the currency in which
it is necessary to find out the price of the first currency> <quantity of the first currency>.
4. When entering the /start or /help command, instructions for using the bot are displayed to the user.
5. When entering the /values command, information about all available currencies should be displayed in a readable form.
6. To take the exchange rate, you need to use the API and send requests to it using the Requests library.
7. To parse the received responses, use the JSON library.
8. If a user makes an error (for example, an incorrect or non-existent currency is entered or a number is entered incorrectly), 
call the ApiException exception that is actually written with the error explanation text.
9. The text of any error indicating the type of error should be sent to the user in messages.
10. To send API requests, describe a class with a static get_price() method that takes three arguments:
- the name of the currency to find out the price for — base,
- the name of the currency, the price in which you need to find out, — quote,
- the amount of the transferred currency is amount and returns the required amount in the currency.
11. Store the telegram bot token in a special config (you can use a .py file).
12. Hide all classes in a file extensions.py .
